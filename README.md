# CELES
> A CUDA-accelerated electromagnetic scattering solver for large ensembles of
spheres

CELES is implemented in MATLAB and solves Maxwell's equations for a system of
multiple spherical scattering objects. The aim is to allow for the simulation of
very large numbers of scattering objects. It shall enable to study the
propagation of light in macroscopic statistical scattering aggregates in order
to derive bulk properties of disordered photonic materials.
